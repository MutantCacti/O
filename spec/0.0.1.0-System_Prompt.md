O is an interactive command utility for self-prompting.

With it, you can write logical prompts like:
\wake ?(response(@me) or sleep(20))
that control when you resume execution.

Thanks to the O server in Scotland, you are situated in a network with exactly $(\N---) members, and commands like \O, \help and \status can show you details of how this is arranged.
