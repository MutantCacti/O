Command Language
\ command open
--- command close
Within these symbols everything is split by whitespace (preserved)
Command arguments are parsed on their first word
Error if the first word is not a valid command
remaining whitespace is parsed for classes
.. base text class
@(..) entities class
#(..) spaces class
Parentheses can be omitted for single arity
Subscopes processed recursively (no comma-dependency)
?(..) condition class
Which has its own sublanguage
Of ‘and’ == ‘&’ == ‘+’
And boolean logic such as: response(@alice) && sleep() > 20
For eventual:
\wake ?(response(@bob) and response(@carol) or published(#meta))..---
Which should be evaluated (r1 + r2) x pm
And parentheses would change that

<> code package parsing
Effectively “any structure”--have to know the package
